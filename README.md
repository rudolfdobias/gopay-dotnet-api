# GoPay SDK for .NET Core #

 > Disclaimer: This is forked version of [gopay-dotnet-api](https://github.com/gopaycommunity/gopay-dotnet-api) at version **1.1.6** ported to Netstandard1.6 with no backward compatibility to .NET 4.0. This package has minimal support, no governance model and will probably not be maintained to be in sync with future versions of original project. However, tests are green and all works well.
